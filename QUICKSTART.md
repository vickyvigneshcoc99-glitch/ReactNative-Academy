## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Use the Component Translator
Before writing any code, check the Component Translator to see the equivalent React Native component. This will save you hours of searching documentation.

### 2. Experiment with Flexbox
The Flexbox Visualizer is your best friend. Spend 15 minutes playing with it to understand how layout works differently in React Native.

### 3. Start with Expo Snack
Don't waste time setting up Xcode or Android Studio initially. Use Expo Snack to learn and prototype quickly.

### 4. Think Mobile-First
Stop thinking in terms of `<div>` and `<span>`. Start thinking in terms of `<View>` and `<Text>`. This mental shift is crucial.

### 5. Read the Notes
Every code example has important notes highlighted in orange. These contain critical gotchas and best practices.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Development Server Won't Start
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Port 3000 Already in Use
```bash
# Use a different port
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

### Expo Snack QR Code Won't Scan
- Make sure your phone and computer are on the same network
- Try opening the Snack URL directly in the Expo Go app
- Check that Expo Go is updated to the latest version

### Code Not Running in Expo Snack
- Check for syntax errors in the code editor
- Make sure you're importing from 'react-native', not 'react'
- Verify that all components are properly closed
